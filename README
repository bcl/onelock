How to tune the DCO using a 32767Hz watch crystal on XT.

It basically amount to running an interrupt off the watch crystal to go off
every 100mS

Run timer a0 off the DCO clock (as well as the system). When the 100mS
interrupt goes off grab the timera0 counter value. Take the difference from
the previous. This will tell you how fast or slow the DCO is running. Change
the DCO to speed it up or slow it down if it is outside the desired
operating range.
