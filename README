1. rewrite in assembly. Needs to fit into 1k of a F1101!
   'c' version certainly doesn't fit.
   Except that if I rewrite in ASM I don't think I have any way to debug it.
   Try to optimize what I have right now.
   It fits (0xFF3C end right now), need to see if it works.

2. Write to flash code for storing authorized serial numbers
   I don't think that's going to fit in the 'c' version

3. PC interface for management
   ditto

4. pyGTK code for management
   ditto
