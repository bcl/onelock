The Gerber files were generated using the standard Eagle CAD scripts and
instructions from http://www.apcircuits.com/resources/links/eagle.html

You can view the gerber files using the gerbv program, note that you have to
pass the names of the layers to view on the command line and it will not
mirror the bottom layer so it will appear backwards if combined with the top
layer and silkscreen.

You can also take a look at my Linux Fest Northwest presentation based on
this project:
